# Interview Algorithm Challenges

This is a collection of solutions to interview challenges I've been posed that were little more than CS algorithm or data structure quizes.

These kinds of coding challenges are objectively bad, for reasons I've discussed at some length, [on my blog][blog] and on twitter. But algorithm questions are even worse. These are well known algorithms, almost always with extremely robust and performant system-provided implementations. And in the event the built in implementations don't work for your situation, it's still absurd to think that a developer would simply reimplement one from scratch, without reference or research, in under an hour. In fact, a developer who tried that on a real project should probably be removed from the project.

So I'm making this reference for myself. And if other people find it useful, so much the better. This probably won't stop companies from asking these questions. It probably won't even stop them from asking _me_ these questions. But at least I'll have done them all once since university.
